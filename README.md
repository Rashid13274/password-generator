### Password-Generator

# Angular Approach:-
- User enters a password length
- Event handler triggered, we store the value as property on our component class instance
- User checks the 'include Letter' checkbox
- Event handler triggered, we store the value as a property on our  component class instance.
- User clicks the 'Generate' button.
- Event handler triggered, we generate a password using the properties collected earlier.
- we update a 'password' propery  on the component class instance, which causes an update of the 
    'output' input.

# Difference between anguler approach and traditional js approach:-
- Using Angular approach:-  Get information out the events.
- Using tradition js approach:- Pull inforamtion out of the DOM.
